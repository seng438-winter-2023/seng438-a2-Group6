# 2 Detailed description of unit test strategy

// including the input partitions you have designed

# 3 Test cases developed

Method: getLength()
Equivalent Class Partition
Actual Output: Pass/Fail
testGetLengthPosPosNum()
First number positive: 1
Second number positive: 100
Range(1, 100)
Expected Output: 100-1=99
Pass
testGetLengthNegPosNum()
First number negative: -10
Second number positive: 5
Range(-10, 5)
Expected Output: 5-(-10)=15
Pass
testGetLengthNegNegNum()
First number negative: -6
Second number negative: -5
Range(-6, -5)
Expected Output: 5-(-6)=1
Pass
testGetLengthZeroZeroNum()
First number: 0
Second number: 0
Range(0, 0)
Expected Output: 0 - 0=0
Pass
testGetLengthZeroPosNum()
First number: 0
Second number positive: 5
Range(0, 5)
Expected Output: 5 - 0=0
Pass
testGetLengthNegZeroNum()
First number negative: -8
Second number: 0
Range(-8, 0)
Expected Output: 0-(-8)=8
Pass
